# Tic-Tac-Toe: Unbeatable Minimax AI


A classic Tic-Tac-Toe game with a perfect, unbeatable AI opponent. This project demonstrates core game logic and advanced algorithmic implementation.

## Technologies used:

* **Python:** Main language.
* **Tkinter:** Used for the Graphical User Interface (GUI).

## Core Features & Skills

* **Minimax Algorithm:** Implements the Minimax recursive algorithm to ensure optimal play by the AI.
* **Game AI:** Demonstrates ability to create game agents that analyze and predict opponent moves.
* **Logic Separation:** Maintains a clear distinction between the game logic (board state) and the GUI (Tkinter buttons).
* **Win Conditions:** Robust checking for horizontal, vertical, and two diagonal win scenarios, plus draw detection.
