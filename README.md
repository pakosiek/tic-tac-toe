# Perceptron: Single-Layer Implementation



A fundamental implementation of the single-layer Perceptron algorithm built from scratch in Python. This project focuses on demonstrating the core mechanics of a neural network, including weight initialization, forward propagation, and the Perceptron Learning Rule, without relying on high-level libraries like Scikit-learn or TensorFlow.

## üöÄ Key Features

* **From Scratch Implementation:** All core logic (learning rule, prediction) is implemented using fundamental NumPy operations.
* **Linear Separability Tests:** Includes tests for classic logic gates (AND, NAND) to verify correct convergence.
* **Data Visualization:** Uses Matplotlib to dynamically plot the dataset and the **decision boundary** (hyperplane) as the perceptron learns across epochs.
* **Testing Learning Rates ($\eta$):** The code structure allows for easy testing and comparison of different learning rates to show their impact on convergence speed.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Python 3.x**
* **NumPy:** Used for efficient array manipulation and weight calculations.
* **Matplotlib:** Used for visualizing the dataset and the decision boundary during the training process.

## üß† Skills Demonstrated

* **Machine Learning Fundamentals:** Deep understanding of supervised learning and the Perceptron model.
* **Numerical Computation:** Efficient use of the NumPy library.
* **Algorithm Visualization:** Ability to visually represent abstract mathematical concepts (decision boundary movement).
* **Code Structure:** Organizing complex logic (training loop, weight update, plotting) into clean functions.
